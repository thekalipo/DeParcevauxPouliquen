\subsection{Purpose}
As reported by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations \cite{fao}, the Indian cultivated area went through a great expansion between 1970 and 2000, going from 140 million to 190 million hectares (ha). In the meantime, the number of farmholding skyrocketed, from 70.5 to 115.6 million. This is the reason why, the average size of farmholdings dropped from 2.30 to 1.41 ha. 
\\
Hence, the Indian government has to tackle many new farms with lower sizes, which may require some helps or incentives.
\\
In this tense context, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) partnered with the state of Telangana to enhance good deviances in the state's agriculture through a data-driven approach.

\subsection{Definitions, Acronyms, Abbreviations}
\subsubsection{Definitions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item User: is a person who received a registration link and successfully registered. It can be a farmer or a policy maker
	\item Policy maker: is a user employed by the state of Telangana to (at least) supervise the agricultural activities in a given area
	\item Farmer: is a user who holds an agricultural business and is recognized as such in the state of Telangana
	\item Maintener: is the person in charge of the maintenance of DREAM
	\item Release: is a set of information that relates what a farmer croped on a specific field during a season, how much water and fertilizer was necessary and what the farmer obtained from it. It has two statutes. Incomplete, when the bare minimum of information that is available at the beginning of the season is input. Complete when the release is completed by data that can't be known before the end of the season.
	\item Batch: is a set of releases of a farmer which are on the same season. Releasing, analyzing a batch thus means releasing and analyzing the production of a farmer on a given season. A batch can be "confirmed" by the farmer, as to say that all the production data are there and are true.
	\item Release and analysis periods: are the two months after the cropping season. The first month is dedicated to the completing of releases and confirming of batches. During the second month, policy makers are supposed to analyze the results, identify well and poorly performing farmers and ask them for best pratices or help them. The time allocated to these periods is based on a similar work, see \cite{seeds}.
	\subitem Cropping season: is the timelapse during which seed are planted, cultivated and finally harvested. There are two major ones in India (officially recognized): Rabi for the spring season and Kharif for the autumnal one.
	\item Help request: is a message from a farmer to his/her policy maker with a label that highlights its importance. The policy maker is supposed to reply with the best pratices or the expertise of agronomists (out of scope).
	\item Incentive: is a financial support from policy maker to a well performing farmer. Assumed to be generated as an e-voucher to improve the working conditions.
	\item Vegetation index: is a number that measures from distance the presence of green vegetation and by such the "health" of the vegetation on a given land. It characterizes the climate resilience (see \cite{vegetationindex})
