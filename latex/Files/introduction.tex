This document has been prepared to help you approaching Latex as a formatting tool for your Travlendar+ deliverables. This document suggests you a possible style and format for your deliverables and contains information about basic formatting commands in Latex. A good guide to Latex is available here \href{https://tobi.oetiker.ch/lshort/lshort.pdf}{https://tobi.oetiker.ch/lshort/lshort.pdf}, but you can find many other good references on the web. 


Writing in Latex means writing textual files having a \texttt{.tex} extension and exploiting the Latex markup commands for formatting purposes. Your files then need to be compiled using the Latex compiler. Similarly to programming languages, you can find many editors that help you writing and compiling your latex code. Here \href{https://beebom.com/best-latex-editors/}{https://beebom.com/best-latex-editors/} you have a short oviewview of some of them. Feel free to choose the one you like.  

Include a subsection for each of the following items\footnote{By the way, what follows is the structure of an itemized list in Latex.}:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Purpose: here we include the goals of the project
\item
Scope: here we include an analysis of the world and of the shared phenomena

Below you see how to define the header for a subsection.
\subsection{Purpose}
First of all lets define the different goals.

\begin{itemize}
	\item 
	G2 : Allow the farmers to retrieve personalized suggestions (On what are based suggestions ? Weather, location, soil humidity, crop, best practices given by others)
	\item
	G3 : Allow the farmers to access data about weather and soil conditions and predictions (In what area ? 10/150 km What kind of data exactly ?)
	\item
	G5 : Allow farmers to discuss on forums (Check if it is part of G6 or if the means are separated)
	\item
	G.1 : Allow farmers to get advices for optimizing their production
	\subitem
	G.1.1 : Allow farmers to retrieve personalized suggestions if they perform poorly
	\subitem
	G.1.2 : Allow farmers to discuss with other farmers about their issues
	\subitem
	G1.2.1 : Allow farmers to create a discussion forum
	\subitem
	G1.2.2 : Allow farmers to look for a specific topic among discussion forums
	\subitem
	G1.2.3 : Allow farmers to send messages on a forum already created
	\subitem
	G1.2.4 : Allow farmers to contact another farmer privately	
	Allow farmers to send a specific help request
	\item
	G2 : Allow farmers to get data that impact their production. 
	Allow farmers to access data about weather conditions and predictions
	\subitem
	G2.1 :
	Allow farmers to access data about soil moisture
	Allow farmers to access data about soil organic carbon
	\item
	G3 : Allow policy makers to globally enhance the productivity of the farmers of their area
	
	Allow policy makers to identify well and poorly performing farmers of their area, according to a chosen metric
	Allow policy makers to incent well performing farmers
	Allow policy makers to fetch best practices among farmers and provide them to others
	Allow policy makers to send personalized suggestions to poorly performing farmers
	
\end{itemize}
