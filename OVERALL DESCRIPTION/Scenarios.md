### Scenario 1 :  A new farmer registers

(The farmer receives an e-mail to suggest registration ?)

Ishaan receives an e-mail from administration that redirects him to the DREAM website registration page. He registers by providing his email address, name, surname, farmID (?) and finally location which he provides by means of the geo-tracking functionality of his smartphone. The system checks that the email address isn't already registered, then sends a validation email to Ishaan. 

After validation, the system fetchs Ishaan's district and mandal, based on his location. It then displays rainfall conditions and predictions on the homepage of Ishaan in his mandal and in his district. It then fetchs the policy maker(s ?) corresponding to this area (**mandal,district ?**). The system sends a notification to the policy maker in charge of the area to acknowledge the registration of Ishaan.  (Does a farmer own fields from one mandal only ?)


### Scenario 2 : A farmer provides his production data and its type (crop, fertilizer)
Dhruv has just finished his crop. He measures his production. He logs in on the DREAM platform where he had already registered. He goes to the page "Release production". He fills the following sections: seed, production amount, surface area of the cultivated fields, location (?), start and end date. 
  
### Scenario 3 : A farmer creates a discussion forum
Shyla has seen her culture giving poor results on the last year due to climate change. He wants to use some fertilizers but he doesn't know about the local/national regulation. He posts a new topic on DREAM.

### Scenario 4 : A farmer looks at the prediction 

### Scenario 5 : A farmer is asked his productivity for the previous year (at the cropping season) and after a while receives an incentive and a request for best pratices

### Scenario 6 : A farmer looks for advice on fertilizer on a forum (filter by tag, area,... ? research). He finds someone that put a good answer -> he joins him privately. He replies to another question.

### Scenario 7 : A farmer receives a notification of help request because his productivity was low on the year

### Scenario 8 : A PM identifies well performing farmers based on some metrics and send them a message + incentive + request for best practices (-> to be sent to agronomists)

### Scenario 9 : A PM identifies poorly performing farmers based on some metrics and send them a message to propose help (-> to be forwarded to agronomists)

### Scenario 10 : A PM goes on the forum to look for the issues farmers face. He notes that the lake of water was a big thing. (He will ask for best practices on this)

### Scenario 11 : A farmer makes an help request (precise + hidden to others) that will be forwarded to agronomist(s)

### Scenario 12 : Adverse event -> help request
