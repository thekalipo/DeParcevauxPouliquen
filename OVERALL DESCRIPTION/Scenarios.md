### Scenario 1 :  A new farmer registers

(The farmer receives an e-mail to suggest registration ?)

Ishaan receives an e-mail from administration that redirects him to the DREAM website registration page. He registers by providing his email address, name, surname, farmID (?) and finally location which he provides by means of the geo-tracking functionality of his smartphone. The system checks that the email address isn't already registered, then sends a validation email to Ishaan. 

After validation, the system fetchs Ishaan's district and mandal, based on his location. It then displays rainfall conditions and predictions on the homepage of Ishaan in his mandal and in his district. It then fetchs the policy maker(s ?) corresponding to this area (**mandal,district ?**). The system sends a notification to the policy maker in charge of the area to acknowledge the registration of Ishaan.  (Does a farmer own fields from one mandal only ?)


### Scenario 2 : A farmer provides his production data and its type (crop, fertilizer)
Shyla has just finished his crop. He measures his production. She logs in on the DREAM platform where she had already registered. She goes to the page "Release production". He fills the following sections: seed variety, seed rate, production amount, surface area of the cultivated fields, location (?), start and end date. 
  
### Scenario 3 : A farmer creates a discussion forum
Dhruv's old tractor is broken. He wonders if he should try to repair it, if possible, and if not, what modern model he should choose. He looks for feedbacks on the forum discussion of the DREAM platform. As he can't find any on the kind of engine he owns, he creates a new topic, explains his issue and waits for answers.

### Scenario 4 : A farmer looks at the prediction 

### Scenario 5 : A farmer is asked his productivity for the previous year (at the cropping season) and after a while receives an incentive and a request for best pratices
Between April and October, Amar crops and harvests rice during the so-called "Kharif"season. In November, he receives a notification from DREAM that urges him to release his production data - seed variety, seed rate, production amount, surface area of the cultivated fields, location (?), start and end date - by the end of the month. He instantly performs. On the first of December, a notification telling the completudeness of the database gathering the production data of the farmers in Amar's area (?) is sent by the system to the dedicated policy maker.

### Scenario 6 : A farmer looks for advice on fertilizer on a forum (filter by tag, area,... ? research). He finds someone that put a good answer -> he joins him privately. He replies to another question.
Diya is not sure about the law regarding some specific fertilizer. She looks for discussion forums on DREAM. She uses as keywords "law", the name of the fertilizer and she filters the results to get late discussions - she knows that the law has changed in the previous years. She finds some farmer whose response handles her issue. Since she wants some more precision, she contacts the farmer, via DREAM, in a private discussion.

### Scenario 7 : A farmer receives a notification of help request because his productivity was low on the year

### Scenario 8 : A PM identifies well performing farmers based on some metrics and send them a message + incentive + request for best practices (-> to be sent to agronomists)


### Scenario 9 : A PM identifies poorly performing farmers based on some metrics and send them a message to propose help (-> to be forwarded to agronomists)
Ananya is a policy maker. On December, 1st, she receives a notification from DREAM telling that all farmers of her area have delivered their production data. She selects some performance metrics among those proposed. The systems ranks the farmers accordingly and displays the ranking. Ananya selects the farmers that may require help. She sends them a message via DREAM ask for a help. 

### Scenario 10 : A PM goes on the forum to look for the issues farmers face. He notes that the lake of water was a big thing. (He will ask for best practices on this)

### Scenario 11 : A farmer makes an help request (precise + hidden to others) that will be forwarded to agronomist(s)

### Scenario 12 : Adverse event -> help request
