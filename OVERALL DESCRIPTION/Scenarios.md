### Scenario 1 :  A new farmer registers

(The farmer receives an e-mail to suggest registration ?)

Anan receives an e-mail from administration that re-directs him to the DREAM website registration page. He registers by providing his mail, name, surname, farmID (?), area, his types of production (how often does he change ?).
He now sees the weather forecasts, soil and humidity conditions of his area on his home page. He uses these information for his current cultures. 

### Scenario 2 : A farmer provides his production data
Josh has finished harvest. He measures his production. He releases the following data on the DREAM platform where he is logged in : amount of production, location, date (of start and end ?). He had poor results despite his use of a new fertilizer.
He makes a feedback in order to find some help. Three days later, he receives a notification on his smartphone saying his help request has been replied.
  
### Scenario 3 : A farmer creates a discussion forum
Josh has seen his culture giving poor results on the last year due to climate change. He wants to use some fertilizers but he doesn't know about the local/national regulation. He posts a new topic on DREAM.
