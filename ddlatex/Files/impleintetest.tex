\subsection{Implementation and integration}
In this part will be presented the steps in order to implement and integrate the DREAM project. Here is our route plan :

We will first start by creating component by component trying to obtain as soon a possible a first viable solution that some users will be able to use. Asking them feedback on the application. It would be useless to develop all the system and see at the end that it will not be used by farmers because it is not ergonomic, too complicated or that is doesn't correspond to their needs.

For this two servers will be used : a testing server and deployment server. First people will build the application on the test server and when some viable functionality ready, pushed into the production server. This will be used for testing by some selected users (farmers and policy makers). 

To do that first of all a continuous integration will be effective with a continuous delivery. When code will be pushed on the development server all the tests will be run before that the new code is accepted. To store the code we will use GitHub or GitLab and use workers.

We will bring development and operation teams together using the devops practice. Devops require more work at the beginning but will permit a better work.

So here will be the beginning for putting into place the DevOps process flow.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Use an agile development process
	\item Adapt the processes for continuous integration and continuous delivery
	\item Automate the software development
	\item Automate the software testing
	\item All this using continuous deployment
\end{enumerate}

	\label{Fig:devopsschema}
\end{figure}

After the setup of the DevOps process flow the application will be built using the following order. Of course as we use DevOps, changes can and will be made, so we can see the following as a guideline (see figure for the components \ref{fig:component_diag}).

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Make available some components to make a first version like Authentication, Release, Visualization, mails and the different databases related to them, data Encryption (important part but as it is not visible from the user point of view can be done after)
	\item forum
	\item messages
	\item calendar and localization
\end{enumerate}
All this using continuous deployment and taking into account the feedback from users, operators ...
Once a good system is present and that all the security and privacy is taken into account the development server will be shared to a bigger number of person. Until it is consider ready to be used by all, at that point it will used in all the state.
\subsection{Test Plan}
Testing should be done during all steps of implementations and integration.

Unit testing should be done for all the individual parts that will be developed. And if possible should be done by another person than whom did the code. Each part have to be tested individually to be sure that it can be used in other parts without errors and bugs. When a new component or change is done in a part all the previous Unit test should be run for all the parts.

At the same time global tests should be performed testing the good working of parts together. The tests will be run automatically before each deployment on the test and production server. To ensure proper implementation and integration of the DREAM system.
